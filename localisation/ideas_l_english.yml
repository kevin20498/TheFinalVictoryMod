 isolationist:0 "200 years Isolationist"
 isolationist_desc:0 "Back in 1776, our founding fathers declared independence for a nation birthed in freedom, peace, and justice. Since then, many have flocked from all corners of the world to escape violence and persecution and we have made a perfect safe haven that is blocked off from the outside world. Why should external conflict be the end of this peace? Thomas Paine did not write Common Sense as a way to rally our people against the Prussians, so why should we dictate our Italian brothers to fight their own families? Even if there is conflict outside our borders, we shouldn't tire ourselves with that sort of nonsense."

After years of war, Americans can say grace as one people again. Now it's our duty to pick up the rubble and rebuild the nation back to its former glory. Soon, our leaders will manage to plot a new course for these United States. Will it take us to the gates of heaven or the depths of hell, only time will tell. We may never salute the Stars and Stripes the same way again."
