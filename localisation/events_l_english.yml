Smith is a slightly more of a reactionary than Dewey, and believes that authoritarian elements are needed in the threatened democracy to keep America from falling into the hands of Vanguardists and Populists. Dewey, on the other hand, firmly believes that it is a mistake to direct America to anything else but proper democracy, and vows to keep the country together under a moderate democratic presidency.

Allred has declared independence for the 3rd Republic of Texas. Despite being called a Republic, the Texan militias are imprisoning political opposition. Many Tejanos (Texan Mexicans) across Texas are under threat from the dominant Anglo-American populace. The second to revolt are the dominant Mormon-American populace of Utah who have declared independence and proclaimed the President of their nation to be Heber J. Grant, the head of the Mormon religion. Hearing of the Texan Rebellion many Anglo-Americans in California have taken arms and declared themselves as the Californian Republic. California has always been a progressive province and opposed to the Mexican Emperor. Worse news has come and states that the Central Americans have taken the opportunity to declare their provinces independent, including Yucatan. The winner of the biggest conflict our country has seen since our independence war with Spain is still up in the air."

The rebels have since consolidated their territory, occupying land as far west as the Rocky Mountains and as far south as the Rio Grande, where they continue to fight Mexican counterattacks. Government officials and regional experts now express concern over whether this revolt could spark a whole new wave of nativist activity in Mexico, especially in the Centroamerica, Yucatan, California, Rio Grande, and Deseret regions of the overextended nation. As the death toll increases and the war continues, people in the region wonder…"

Vanguardist cells in Yucatan, Mormons in Deseret, nationalists in Central America, separatists in the Rio Grande region, and Californios have all risen up against Mexico and now approach the country’s heartland. California, Deseret, Rio Grande, and Texas have formed an uneasy pact of sorts to better fight their common Mexican enemy, while the Central Americans have agreed to set aside their differences until the external threat to their people is addressed. The Mexican government is in chaos as the army scrambles to address every front and quell revolt after revolt.
