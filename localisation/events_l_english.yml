 USA.1.t:0 "Situation of America in 1936"
 USA.1.d:0 "Two hundred years have passed since the United States gained its independence from Great Britain. The country has fallen into chaos, with vanguardism and national-populism on the rise, the very foundation of the American dream is being threatened.  Additionally, the country is plagued by economic mismanagement on the part of the federal government, which is led by the Independent American Party for Liberty. The new government is surrounded by hostile neighbors, including Quebec, who is hoping to use the United States in order to regain the French mainland from the Republicans. Will the United States manage to hold itself together and protect its sovereignty and values at the same time?"
 USA.1.a:0 "Glory glory Hallelujah!"
